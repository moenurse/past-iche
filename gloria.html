		<div id="question1"> <p>Who are you and what do you do?</p></div>

			<div id="answer1"> <p>Hello, my name is Gloria Pham and I am one of the co-founders of Archival Toronto. My business partner Carl Chiang is the managing partner and I am head of operations. We host fashion events in Toronto, and we are known for our bi-annual archive fashion pop-ups. We strive to provide resources and make fashion more accessible to young creatives in Toronto. My background is in Law and Business.</p></div>
		</div>
	<div id="containerq2">
		<div id="question2">To what extent do you believe plagiarism occurs in fashion? If so, how were you first introduced to the notion of plagiarism in the industry?</div>
		<div id="answer2">I think plagiarism has been part of the fashion industry forever. It seems particularly rampant now, especially in the age of fast fashion. I was first introduced to it really early when I first started being interested in fashion. I would look up runway shows and gawk at the clothes, but as a high-school student there was no way I could afford anything at the department stores. I read lots of articles online about "cheaper options" or "dupes", where fast fashion or other brands offered the same design, clearly taken from the runway, only slightly modified or at a different price point.</div>
		
		<div id="question2">Is all plagiarism equal? Why or why not?</div>
		
		<div id="answer2">I don't believe it is all equal. Two high end brands copying one another may be in bad taste and legally wrong, but it isn't necessarily harmful in my opinion. However, fast fashion copying high fashion seems cheap and uninspired, since by definition fast fashion's goal is to push out as much "trendy" product as possible. It just gives a diluted and disposable version of the high-end design. Fast fashion brands copying independent creators is the worst. Independent creators do not have the same distribution channels as a large fast fashion company, and is much more likely to profit off a stolen design, taking it away from the original creator who is entitled to that income.</div>
	</div>

	<div id="containerq3">
		<div id="question3">If you recognize an item is a mimicry of another, would that make you want it more or less?</div>
		<div id="answer3">If its a blatant copy of another designer's original design, then no. I would want to support the original artist and not encourage a copycat. To me, a copy doesn't hold the same amount of value that the original does and the person who made the item is important to me as well.</div>
		
		<div id="question3">Is there a difference between homage/inspiration vs. imitation? Thoughts?</div>
		
		<div id="answer3">Definitely. Homage and inspiration is analyzing something and finding out exactly what inspires you about it. Imitation is taking the design and passing it off as your own. Lots of designs start out as imitation but people put in their own viewpoints and processes to create a unique idea.</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq5">
		<div id="question5">Do you believe trends homogenize or diversify fashion?</div>
		<div id="answer5">I think trends can diversify fashion. A designer can take a trend and then add their own touches to it, giving it character specific to their brand. It increases the range of product available to customers based on their own preferences.</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq6" align="center">
		<div id="question6" align="center">To what extent do you believe that plagiarism is used as an intended business strategy? </div>

			<div id="answer6" align="center">Plagiarism can be used as a complete business strategy in the fashion industry, fast fashion especially. Popular brands like Fashion Nova work quickly to replicate celebrity outfits and have them available to consumers within hours. Zara picks looks from runways and creates a nearly identical item, just vague enough to avoid copyright. Plagiarism is an easy way for brands to focus resources on other parts of their business and not on innovation or design.</div>
		</div>

	<div id="containerq7">
		<div id="question7">Do you think social media has affected plagiarism? Why/how or why/how not?</div>
		<div id="answer7">Plagiarism is definitely easier in the age of information, since designers have more access to resources like old runway shows or patterns. However, it also makes it much easier for plagiarism to be spotted. It is all about how someone chooses to use social media. For us, social media has made it so much easier to reference and do research on our pieces, but it can easily be accessed by another person with the intent to copy.</div>
		
	</div>

	<div id="containerq8">
		<div id="question8"> What do you think can be done to start combating plagiarism in the industry?</div>
		<div id="answer8">One of our goals of Archival Toronto is to combat this plagiarism through empowering creatives and local designers. We want to provide the inspiration and resources for people to understand the design process and be encouraged to produce their own original designs, through appreciating (not copying!) established designers of the past. It's about teaching those in the industry about pushing boundaries and finding their voice. I think this awareness and knowledge is one of the most long-lasting and impactful ways to address plagiarism. Copying is easy, innovation is not. We want to have designers think about the type of impact and message they are putting out into the world (creatively and environmentally). In our society of excess, the world does not need more copies.</div>

	</div>
	<div id="containerq9">
		<div id="question9">In your personal opinion, would you consider fashion a form of art?</div>
		<div id="answer9">Yes. To look at the craftsmanship and inspiration and design put into a piece of clothing on the runway and not think that it is a form of art and expression seems silly. Fashion tells a story and displays the designer's skill like any other medium. We place such a large focus on vintage and archival clothing because each piece is representative of the designer and their process.</div>
		
	</div>

	<div id="containerq10">
		<div id="question10">To what extent do you believe that fashion is a signifier of one's identity?</div>
		<div id="answer10">Fashion is a large part, so much that even a lack of interest in fashion is still a signifier of the person's identity. Fashion expresses a message and a feeling, and people choose what they want to project.</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq12">
		<div id="question12">Do you consciously consume any fashion goods in an effort to portray a certain self inspired by fashion trends?</div>
		<div id="answer12">I personally try to avoid "trendy"- I want to buy pieces that I'm comfortable in and have more perceived value than just "cool". I loved vintage clothing because it was different then what was available to me. I don't consciously try to portray myself as someone inspired by fashion trends. I want to represent myself as someone with an appreciation for design, and somebody who doesn't take themselves too seriously!</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq13">
		<div id="question13">Describe your preferred stores and reasons to shop there?</div>
		<div id="answer13">I love shopping online, especially on eBay, to find vintage or cheap designer pieces. I also go to many of the consignment stores here in Toronto during their sales. My favourite two are Fashionably Yours on Queen Street and VSP Consignment on Dundas West. Fashionably Yours is the place to find deals and I love to chat with the staff, while VSP has great curation and has amazing end of season sales. I shop secondhand because its environmentally friendly and you get more for your money. I can buy pieces that I'm confident in and as a reseller, I'm constantly looking for inventory. The only way to find certain pieces from specific eras that fit within our business criteria is through the secondhand market.</div>

	</div>
	<div id="containerq15">
		<div id="question15" align="center">Do you make any personal effort in your consumption habits to combat plagiarism?</div>

			<div id="answer15" align="center">After starting Archival Toronto, I have made many changes to my habits and what I choose to buy. Through the business, I learned what gives an item its value: whether the design, the fabric, or the inspiration, and I apply this type of mindset with things I buy. I don't buy knock offs because it has no value to me, and it would be a waste of my money. I don't shop at any fast fashion stores and almost everything I own is secondhand. I try to purchase from designers and brands that I like, and have knowledge about. I put a lot of effort into my shopping to find great pieces at a price I'm willing to pay. I'm very patient when I'm shopping and I will dig through thrift stores and consignment shops for hours. I also encourage my friends to buy designer and avoid cheap knock-offs. </div>
