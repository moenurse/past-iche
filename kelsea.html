		<div id="role">CREATIVE</div>
		<div id="dt">03.07.2019</div>	
	</div>

	<div>
		<div id="question1"> <p>Who are you and what do you do?</p></div>

			<div id="answer1"> <p>My name is Kelsea and I am a Content Manager at a branding agency. Every day is different, but generally I am writing, producing, creating or managing the execution of branding and branded content.</p></div>
		</div>
	<div id="containerq2">
		<div id="question2">To what extent do you believe plagiarism occurs in fashion? If so, how were you first introduced to the notion of plagiarism in the industry?</div>
		<div id="answer2">I think that plagiarism is extremely prevalent across many industries, including fashion. My first introduction to plagiarism in fashion was with knockoff bags - debatably the most blatant form of plagiarism.</div>
		
		<div id="question2">If you recognize an item is a mimicry of another, would that make you want it more or less?</div>
		
		<div id="answer2">It depends what the garment looks like. If I recognize that it is a straight copy or extremely similar, it makes me want to buy the item less. However if the garment is subtly inspired by another design, I may be interested in purchasing it if it is a more cost-friendly version.</div>
	</div>

	<div id="containerq3">
		<div id="question3">Is all plagiarism equal? Why or why not?</div>
		<div id="answer3">I think there’s a little bit of a hierarchy in plagiarism. I’m sure the people who are being plagiarized don’t feel that way, but it seems extra immoral to be stealing from independent creators who are struggling to make ends meet.</div>
		<div id="quote3" align="center">"I think intent plays a large role in deciphering between inspiration and imitation."</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq4">
		<div id="question4">Is there a difference between homage/inspiration and imitation? Thoughts?</div>
		<div id="answer4">Everything comes from something else. It’s likely impossible to find something completely original that has never been produced before. I think intent plays a large role in deciphering between inspiration and imitation. Is the designer consciously copying? Are they adding their own interpretation? Does the designer understand the history of design? </div>
		
	</div>

	<div id="containerq5">
		<div id="question5">Do you believe trends homogenize or diversify fashion?</div>
		<div id="answer5">I think trends homogenize fashion. Sometimes fashion gets stuck in a continuous loop; a trend becomes popular, people support the trend, designers need to make money so they continue to design what sells instead of creating new things. It keeps everyone dressing the same.</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq6" align="center">
		<div id="question6" align="center">To what extent do you believe that plagiarism is used as an intended business strategy? </div>

			<div id="answer6" align="center">Plagiarism is the intended business strategy of fast fashion. Brands want to make money, and often plagiarism is the means to an end.</div>
		</div>

	<div id="containerq7">
		<div id="question7">Do you think social media has affected plagiarism? Why/how or why/how not?</div>
		<div id="answer7">We’ve never been more connected than in 2019, and it’s incredibly easy to find “inspiration” on social media platforms. We are constantly being inundated with other people’s work and it’s difficult to create something completely new and fresh. It will be  interesting to watch as call out culture becomes more prevalent, if plagiarism lessens.</div>
		
	</div>

	<div id="containerq8">
		<div id="question8"> What do you think can be done to start combating plagiarism in the industry?</div>
		<div id="answer8">Knowledge is power, and right now people either don’t know or don’t care that much about plagiarism in the industry. At this point, awareness might be the most useful plan of action. I think platforms like @diet_prada are doing a good job of bringing awareness to the issue, however I don’t foresee this issue going away until consumers stop purchasing plagiarized goods. In a capitalist culture, principles don’t change until money is affected.</div>

	</div>
	<div id="containerq9">
		<div id="question9">In your personal opinion, would you consider fashion a form of art?</div>
		<div id="answer9">Fashion certainly should be considered a form of art. Elements of colour, texture, design, and technique are used to evoke a feeling when draped over the body. I don’t see this as anything different from other art forms.</div>
		
	</div>

	<div id="containerq10">
		<div id="question10">To what extent do you believe that fashion is a signifier of one's identity?</div>
		<div id="answer10">I have often thought about this question and am still looking for a conclusion. I think that fashion can be a signifier of the identity that you choose. Whether people want to admit it or not, everyone is heavily influenced by culture, societal norms, and trends. Your fashion does say something about who you are and what you value, or at least says something about who you want to be and what you want people to think you value. Even if you don’t participate in “fashion”, by default that says something about your identity.</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq11">
		<div id="quote11" align="center">"we've never been more connected than in 2019, and it’s incredibly easy to find “inspiration” on social media platforms."</div>
		
	</div>

	<div id="containerq12">
		<div id="question12">Do you consciously consume any fashion goods in an effort to portray a certain self inspired by fashion trends?</div>
		<div id="answer12">As I become older, I’m trying to be more conscious of what fashion I’m consuming. I often ask myself why I’m purchasing an item and am more practical in my choices. I am trying to choose items that feel true to myself and are less influenced by trends.</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq13">
		<div id="question13">Describe your preferred stores and reasons to shop there?</div>
		<div id="answer13">I prefer to shop vintage because you find unique pieces, the price point is more affordable, and it supports the recycling of clothing. </div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq14">
		<div id="quote14" align="center">"I think that fashion can be a signifier of the identity that you choose. "</div>
		
	</div>
	<div id="containerq15">
		<div id="question15" align="center">Do you make any personal effort in your consumption habits to combat plagiarism?</div>

			<div id="answer15" align="center">As I’ve become more aware of runway shows, it’s much easier to spot plagiarism in fast fashion. If I’m aware of any plagiarism, I will definitely avoid purchasing that item.</div>
