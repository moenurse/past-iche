		<div id="question1"> <p>Who are you and what do you do?</p></div>

			<div id="answer1"> <p>My name is Roberto Lagman. I’m a 4th year student at Ryerson University, previously graduated from Fashion Management at George Brown. I’ve worked at and held a number of positions in numerous retail stores but am currently working in the insurance industry. And I’m very much into clothing.</p></div>
		</div>
	<div id="containerq2">
		<div id="question2">To what extent do you believe plagiarism occurs in fashion? If so, how were you first introduced to the notion of plagiarism in the industry?</div>
		<div id="answer2">So the extent that I believe plagiarism occurs in fashion is pretty extensive to be honest. It happens at almost at every facet of the industry from high end to low end. Outside of the social responsibility issues that the industry surrounds itself with, this is a different level of criticism that people should levy on the fashion industry more. One of the most important avenues for me to discover that plagiarism exists is through slanderous pics of plagiarism in action on old menswear fashion forums like “Super Future". Meme-esque photos would be posted of the work that plagiarized and the inspiration that it is from. The posts were pretty slanderous in nature, meant to call brands out. This was before other more well knowledged resources came to be such as Diet Prada, and fashion publications are picking up on this now too. It was bound to happen, but those are the resources that I used.</div>
		
		<div id="question2">If you recognize an item is a mimicry of another, would that make you want it more or less?</div>
		
		<div id="answer2">I feel that I’m very much less inclined to buy the item. I think it's a little telling of you as a person if you are aware of the dishonesty surrounding the product, so I can't see much incentive to buy it after that point. I’d avoid it like the plague.</div>
	</div>

	<div id="containerq3">
		<div id="question3">Is all plagiarism equal? Why or why not?</div>
		<div id="answer3">I don’t believe all plagiarism is equal when you analyze the relationship between the types of plagiarism that occurs. I believe high fashion brands stealing from independent designers and high fashion stealing from other high fashion is morally incorrect. It’s creative avarice that I think is the main factor behind my dislike for high end to high end fashion plagiarism. I think that to stay at the top you have to continue to innovate, push, be original and bring ideas to the table that made you famous in the first place. Once you start copying other designers it begins to feel as though they’re out of touch. Maybe you should reconsider what you want to do or reconsider your vision for the brand. But I think this pales in comparison to plagiarism between high end to independent designers. Established designers taking advantage of their power over independent designers with their lack of structure, finances, exposure, voice and ultimately their identity, to fight back against the wrong doings that these high end or bigger brands in general can exude over them. Manipulating that power dynamic is extremely unethical, and I think that’s probably the worst of plagiarism. But I believe the low end to high fashion plagiarism is probably a moral grey area for me because I believe the very nature of high end brands being concerned with status, exclusivity, and fantastical fame, that can’t be achieved by everyone. And the people they require business from, well there’s definitely not as many. So to fill in its place, you have mass market retailers who have come in and optimized the process of distilling unattainable pieces into more attainable ones that everyone can afford. They just sort of filled in the cracks that the luxury industry has left due to their ethos. And I think it’s important that some people can build identities around their clothing in a way that provides them options. I personally would never buy those pieces, but I guess that’s a different answer altogether.</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq4">
		<div id="question4">Is there a difference between homage/inspiration and imitation? Thoughts?</div>
		<div id="answer4">I do believe that there's a very big difference. What is that saying? Good artists create and great artists steal... something like that. While there is some serious truth in that idea, how I interpret it is that you can borrow very subtle but identifiable traits of one designer and use it as almost an easter egg or nod in the way you would for an homage in their own pieces. But it would be different enough so that the whole identity of the piece doesn’t full out resemble the designer that included that homage, and it's just there as a sign of respect to the designers that had maybe influenced this other person’s passions. As for imitation, it’s obvious and clear to see when something is created as a pure mimic of the original. I can't really put a finger on why I would know or why a lot of other people would know, but maybe it's an intrinsic notion that we have about seeing things which are so similar to what we’ve seen before that we are instantly put off by it when it’s meant to be presented as something else.</div>
		
	</div>

	<div id="containerq5">
		<div id="question5">Do you believe trends homogenize or diversify fashion?</div>
		<div id="answer5">I think you can interpret this question in 2 ways. Both on a macro and on a micro scale. On a macro scale, trends actually help to diversify fashion because I think when something becomes a trend and a large culture adopts it, it naturally leads into counter cultures which try to change that and challenge the status quo. So on a macro scale I think they diversify fashion, but on a micro scale, trends very much homogenize fashion because it almost feels like everyone is wearing the exact same thing. If you don't particularly care about fashion and you don’t really think about it, you’re subconsciously influenced by people around you in your day to day life. You become comfortable with the looks of certain things and you have to really work to step out of that mindset.</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq6">
		<div id="question6" align="center">To what extent do you believe that plagiarism is used as an intended business strategy? </div>

			<div id="answer6" align="center">I believe it's extensively used as an intended business strategy. I think it's very much a sign of the information age where we’re so caught up in non stop trend cycles and everyone is looking to cash in on a mini gold rush of a certain trend or style. So if they can optimize a way to cash in on a trend at its peak and most profitable point, then they very much must structure their business around that. And if they do, then they have to develop business strategies that cater to that especially if is has proven time and time again that it works. Zara is a perfect example of this, so it's completely an intended business strategy and it happens between all relationships of the plagiarism spectrum or relationship matrix.</div>
		</div>

	<div id="containerq7">
		<div id="question7">Do you think social media has affected plagiarism? Why/how or why/how not?</div>
		<div id="answer7">Absolutely social media has affected plagiarism. Especially because it is directly related to the information age and the extremely rapid way in how we receive information. Social media is one of these key elements of this info cycle. It’s a hurricane of information that causes trends to turn around quickly. I know that’s not the most profound statement, but it definitely makes optimizing the process of trend easier for bigger brands because they can always look at what people are creating and what they are enjoying and liking and make business decisions based off of that. But I think it affects everyone on every spectrum. Social media is almost like the equalizing force. It’s almost like a cyclical relationship of people plagiarizing each other, but through all of that you find a diamond in the rough. That diamond is the next new emergent designer that wows everyone and then the cycle starts again and new varied iterations will always appear and I think that’s the beauty of it.</div>

	<div id="containerq8">
		<div id="question8"> What do you think can be done to start combating plagiarism in the industry?</div>
		<div id="answer8">The 1st and primary thing to combat plagiarism in the industry is to provide information  to everyone and to keep that info about plagiarism existing so more people can know about it and broadcast it so that everyone is aware of the issue. Hopefully through that exposure, people will make better, more informed decisions about their purchases. Maybe that would even translate into decisions they make in other facets of their life too. That's a lofty ideal to dream of, for one thing to lead to another.  But even if it was just for the [fashion] industry, I think it would be cool to see that and if people combat it with their money, it could cause radical change within the fashion industry to be more honest with everyone.</div>

	</div>
	<div id="containerq9">
		<div id="question9">In your personal opinion, would you consider fashion a form of art?</div>
		<div id="answer9">Fashion is a form of art just the same as everything else. You have an idea in your head, you think of iterations of this idea then you create it, put it out there into the world and hopefully people will appreciate the time effort and energy you put into this thing. And that they understand the purpose of what you try to create. It’s almost an extension of you as an individual and I think /that/ to me is what art is. It’s the meaning of this that is very abstract and I definitely think it can be applied to fashion.</div>
		
	</div>

	<div id="containerq10">
		<div id="question10">To what extent do you believe that fashion is a signifier of one's identity?</div>
		<div id="answer10">That’s a hard question to answer. I think looking at it through the lense of one’s immersion within fashion and not necessarily the cultural lense that you would see if you were to study it in a more ethnographic sense, is very much a big signifier of one’s identity. The more immersed you are in fashion in general - and if our identities are just culminations of our interest and presentations of self - then fashion plays a big role in that. So I think that diminishes the less invested you are in fashion. I think people straddle the median between their interest in fashion and identity where it is somewhat part of their identity but not their entire identity. I think it’s especially true [fashion as a signifier for identity] for people who are into it.</div>

		<div id="question11" align="center">"It’s almost an<br>extension of you<br>as an individual,<br>and I think that<br>to me is what<br>art is."</div>
		
	</div>

	<div id="containerq12">
		<div id="question12">Do you consciously consume any fashion goods in an effort to portray a certain self inspired by fashion trends?</div>
		<div id="answer12">I don’t believe that I do that because I’ve been interested in fashion for so long now that I’ve really carved my own identity and my own interests out within this sphere, so I don’t believe I’m as influenced by trends as other people. That’s not to say that those that follow trends aren’t as creative, it’s just that for me personally, I wouldn’t be swayed enough to buy something just to portray myself as part of a trend. It’s not really something that I have any vested interest in. I keep in touch with trends but don’t follow trends so I don’t feel the need to buy all the time. Because of this, I don’t feel the pressure to keep buying clothes to stay on trend so I buy much less often. As a result, there's a greater value proposition for me to save money and buy the high end clothes directly rather than the knock offs made by fast fashion companies that try to emulate these designer pieces.</div>

	</div>

	<div id="containerq13">
		<div id="question13">Describe your preferred stores and reasons to shop there?</div>
		<div id="answer13">Some of my prefered stores are not a lot of the stores locally within Toronto. Ever since Working Title closed I haven’t shopped in many places in the city cuz not many places carry the brands that really resonate with me or are as important to me as the brands that were carried at there. If they do exist here in the city, they are very expensive now. But if it do want to go and buy something new I would say Ssense. It’s always a very reliable place to buy things and they have such an extensive collection. Another nod would have to go to Tres Bien which is based out of Sweden. Now of course, since we don’t live in Sweden I have to access their shop digitally, but that hasn’t deterred me from having a really wonderful time with their brand listing, pricing, and buys. Granted not all of their stuff is for me, but when I do find something I like, it’s priced well enough that I am inclined to buy it should I need to. Lastly, I really do enjoy purchasing through the resale market. Grailed or online auctions for example are one of my favourite ways to get older designer merchandise for a reasonable price.</div>

	</div>
	<div id="containerq15">
		<div id="question15" align="center">Do you make any personal effort in your consumption habits to combat plagiarism?</div>

			<div id="answer15" align="center">I think my consumption habits as a whole have been very curated to combat fashion plagiarism in the industry. I research and look into each piece that I buy so that it’s not really treading on hot water. Even if it is, I do want to understand its history more because I don’t buy clothes very often so that’s another thing that persuades the buying decision. I don’t buy just to buy, so each piece is something that I think about a lot and I make sure it fits what I need.</div>
