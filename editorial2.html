    <div id="bodycopy"><p>Fashion is constantly changing and trends are rotating at a pace that is becoming increasingly harder to keep up with. As people aim to stay fashionable, they are purchasing more than they would need in order to maintain a current and relevant wardrobe.<p>

<p>The fashion cycle has been steadily accelerating for years, to the point of causing designer burnout. As Raf Simons admitted after leaving Dior in 2015, making six shows per year leaves no time for incubating ideas and ultimately resulted in him settling on design and losing passion. Designers are faced with the seemingly near impossible task of balancing business with creativity. Fast fashion is most often cited as the cause of this stress and designer burnout. Companies such as Inditex, parent company of ZARA, have created a market of intense consumer supply and demand with their ability to deliver runway looks overnight for a fraction of the cost. This in turn leads to people tiring of the trends quicker as there is no period of anticipation for a collection’s release. Instead it feeds consumer’s demand for instant gratification without allowing incubation time for excitement of new trends.<p>

<p>Alongside the rise of fast fashion has been social media. With the current relevancy of apps and websites like Instagram and youtube, consumers are bombarded with trend after trend, oftentimes multiple at a time. Social media has accelerated the rate of fashion cycles as multiple trends can now filter through millions of people at once. It’s no longer enough to be on trend in just your city, you must now have multiple styles to be able to adapt and be able to be trendy online to thousands of people around the world as well.<p>

<p>Social media makes people more inclined to not only portray their status but to compare ourselves to others around the world and strive to be like those we see online. This now means that our online personas must satisfy multiple ideals and standards. In order to garner “likes” and popularity, staying fashionable and worrying about personal image is more important now than ever in an era where everyone and anyone can become a famous influencer. This desire to constantly be seen in the “right things” fuels a period of overconsumption as we try to keep up with aspirational identities. Sites that have risen in popularity such as Wish, Boohoo and Fashion nova are used to purchase items for a few dollars that can be worn once for a photo and tossed away. The attainable price points of these new fast fashion brands make each purchase feel guilt free, ensuring that there is little chance of people pausing to second guess the realistic need of the item. This results in people buying needless amounts of clothing to secure the most current trend pieces. You are less likely to value an item worth $10 and this promotes a mentality that clothing is disposable.<p>

<p>On average, North Americans purchase and add 70 new articles of clothing into their closets per year. This is most likely an unnecessary amount of clothing for most people. In an period of global environmental distress concern, it is important to consider our own impact. Overconsumption is one of the first and easiest steps that consumers can address and aim to change. This requires the least amount of drastic change making it easy to adopt, asking only that consumers carefully consider the actual need of the item by assessing the value of the item on a want vs. need scale. As of late, many trends are popularizing the reconsideration of material needs such as the “Marie Kondo” effect, minimalism trend and sustainable fashion. Some brands such as H&M are also beginning to address this current issue of over consumption by introducing garment recycling programs. It’s easy though to think that textile recycling programs and second hand donation shops are an answer to our current state of consumption. In reality, textile recycling techniques are nowhere near advanced enough to meet the demand and second hand shops such as Value Village and Goodwill are receiving too much clothing to even put onto the sales floor. Instead they are having to resort to selling most of the garments to a third parties that find alternate uses for them or ship them overseas. In the end, the best solution truly is to reframe the way in which we consume clothing by wearing things out to the end of their life, valuing the items that we own and ultimately, just buying less.<p>
